Scripts:

Music Script (make sure you have your id!)

Script 1 (Normal Standard Playlist):

local SoundGroup = game.SoundService.SoundGroup -- Change SoundGroup to whatever you named your SoundGroup
local Playlist = {
    Sound1 = SoundGroup.Sound1, -- Change sound name accordingly 
    Sound2 = SoundGroup.Sound2,
    Sound3 = SoundGroup.Sound3,-- Change sound name accordingly 
    -- Add more sounds if needed
}

local function PlaySound(Sound)
    Sound:Play()
    Sound.Ended:Wait()
end

while true do
    for _, Sound in pairs(Playlist) do
        PlaySound(Sound)
        wait(2) -- The wait time between songs
    end
end


Script 2 (Random Playlist): 

local SoundGroup = game.SoundService.SoundGroup -- Change SoundGroup to whatever you named your SoundGroup
local Playlist = {
 SoundGroup.Sound1,
 SoundGroup.Sound2,
 SoundGroup.Sound3,
 -- Add more sounds if needed
}

local function PlayRandomSound()
 local randomIndex = math.random(1, #Playlist)
 local Sounds = Playlist[randomIndex]

 if Sounds then
  Sounds:Play()
  Sounds.Ended:Wait()
 end
end

while true do
 PlayRandomSound() 
 wait(2) -- The wait time between songs
end




Extra: (Mute button) (you need to create a screengui)


Script 3 (Mute Button):

script.Parent.Text = "Mute" -- The initial text when the game loads
local PlaylistActive = false
local MusicSoundGroup = game:GetService("SoundService").SoundGroup -- Change SoundGroup to whatever your SoundGroup is called

script.Parent.MouseButton1Click:Connect(function()
 if not PlaylistActive then
  MusicSoundGroup.Volume = 0
  script.Parent.Text = "Unmute"
  PlaylistActive = true
 else
  MusicSoundGroup.Volume = 0.5 -- This is the volume of the audio when they turn it back on
  script.Parent.Text = "Mute"
  PlaylistActive = false
 end
end)
